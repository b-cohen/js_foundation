# Instructions
Lucian's girlfriend is on her way home, and he hasn't cooked their anniversary dinner!
In this exercise, you're going to write some code to help Lucian cook an exquisite lasagna from his favorite cookbook.
You have four tasks related to the time spent cooking the lasagna.

## Tasks
### 1. Expected Oven Time 
  Use `const` to declare a variable named 'EXPECTED_MINUTES_IN_OVEN ' for the expected oven time in minutes.The lasagna should be in the oven for 40 minutes.

### 2. Remaining Oven Time
  The actual minutes the lasagna has been in the oven can change, so use `let` to declare a variable named 'actualMinutesInOven' and assign it 25 minutes. Declare another `let` variable named 'remainingMinutesInOven'that calculates the remaining time the lasagna needs in the oven by subtracting the actual minutes from the expected oven time.

### 3. Preparation Time
  The number of layers can be declared with `var` to see the difference (though `let`/`const` are preferred in modern code). Declare another `var` variable named 'preparationTimeInMinutes' and one named 'numberOfLayers'  that calculates the total preparation time with 3 layers, assuming each layer takes 2 minutes to prepare.


### 4. Total Working Time
  Declare a variable named 'totalTimeInMinutes' (use `let`) that stores the total working time, which is the sum of the preparation time and the actual minutes the lasagna has been in the oven.
